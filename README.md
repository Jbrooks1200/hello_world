# hello_world
My first repository
Hello all,
My name is Jusitn and I just began coding a few weeks ago. So far I love it and find it refreshing and exciting 
as I hope to change careers.  I hope to come out of all of this as a full stack developer as I find all aspects 
of this industry very interesting. I want to learn as much as possible, so any tips or tricks for learning and 
writing good easy to follow code I am all ears.  Like I said I just started so at the moment I am just learning
HTML, CSS and Python.
